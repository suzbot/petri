This is a document where I'm dumping my random ideas as I have them, that haven't been added to
the roadmap or other docs yet.

Goal of this document is that it can be automatically reviewed when roadmap planning to see if any
of these smaller items make sense to incorporate into the plan as we go along.

When items are completed OR documented as part of a roadmap, requirement, or plan elsewhere,
then they can be removed from this list.

1. Reorder the fields in the Details panel (low - still needs product decision)
2. Assess other possible unicode symbols for entities
3. When implementing character memory, revisit how much we keep in the action log. May need to consider world time vs real time.
4. Fake hello world loading screen (very low)
5. Adjust start screen title and start keys (low)
    - === Petri ===
    - R to start with Random Characters
    - C to create Characters
6. Extended ascii art mushrooms on title screen

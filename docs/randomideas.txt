This is a document where I'm dumping my random ideas as I have them, that haven't been added to
the roadmap or other docs yet.

Goal of this document is that it can be automatically reviewed when roadmap planning to see if any
of these smaller items make sense to incorporate into the plan as we go along.

When items are completed OR documented as part of a roadmap, requirement, or plan elsewhere,
then they can be removed from this list.

#Ready Ideas
- Replace l for full log with x on all activity panel to expand
- Create a flag that lets you control how many chars are created? Or just adjust character creation screen?
- remove single char mode from ui, skip the screen phase where selecting single vs multi

# Ideas that aren't ready yet:
- hello world loading screen
- Adjust start screen title and start keys (low)
    - === Petri ===
    - R to start with Random Characters
    - C to create Characters
- Extended ascii art mushrooms on title screen
- Reorder the fields in the Details panel (low - still needs product decision)

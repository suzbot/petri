This is a document where I'm dumping my random ideas as I have them, that haven't been added to
the roadmap or other docs yet.

Goal of this document is that it can be automatically reviewed when roadmap planning to see if any
of these smaller items make sense to incorporate into the plan as we go along.

When items are completed OR documented as part of a roadmap, requirement, or plan elsewhere,
then they can be removed from this list.

#Ready Ideas
- Re-evaluate how characters eat carried items:
    - they definitely shouldn't eat a carried item they know is poison, right?
    - Should they eat a carried disliked item instead of a liked nearby item? How does need tier play in?
    - How do we keep characters from getting stuck carrying around poisoned items they won't eat? Will future plans for item handling take care of that naturally? (see future brainstorming rtf)
- Reset all time configs so that a "day" for the characters is 2 game minutes long (.5 seconds ~ 6 min activity, 1.5 seconds ~ 18 min activity, 5 seconds ~ 1 hr, 40 seconds ~ 8 hrs)
- ability to edit name of existing character on map
- sticks and nuts spawn randomly, but do not grow, they are "placed" on the ground by falling from the canopy.
- make background of map green
- generate pond at world beginning
- generate stream at world beginning
- generate clay pit?? Maybe later for clay crafting

# Ideas that aren't ready yet:
- hello world loading screen
- Adjust start screen title and start keys (low)
    - === Petri ===
    - R to start with Random Characters
    - C to create Characters
- Extended ascii art mushrooms on title screen
- Reorder the fields in the Details panel (low - still needs product decision)

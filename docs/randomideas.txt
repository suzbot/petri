This is a document where I'm dumping my random ideas as I have them, that haven't been added to
the roadmap or other docs yet.

Goal of this document is that it can be automatically reviewed when roadmap planning to see if any
of these smaller items make sense to incorporate into the plan as we go along.

When items are completed OR documented as part of a roadmap, requirement, or plan elsewhere,
then they can be removed from this list.

1. Reorder the fields in the Details panel (low - still needs product decision)
2. Assess other possible unicode symbols for entities
3. Make sure all actions log fills up available vertical space, make sure we're not losing actions, make sure 'all action' limit isn't cutting off short term memories.
4. When implementing character memory, revisit now much we keep in the action log. May need to consider world time vs real time.
5. ESC should go back to start screen instead of fully quitting? or q?
6. Fake hello world loading screen (very low)
7. Adjust start screen title and start keys (low)
    - === Petri ===
    - R to start with Random Characters
    - C to create Characters
8. Ability to save the game (important, where should this be on roadmap relative to items in docs/vision.txt?)
9. Update character creation so that all colors are always available (even as more are added to list)

This is a document where I'm dumping my random ideas as I have them,
that haven't been added to the roadmap or other docs yet.

Goal of this document is that it can be automatically reviewed when roadmap planning
to see if any of these smaller items make sense to incorporate into the plan as we go along.

When items are completed OR documented as part of a roadmap, requirement, or plan elsewhere,
then they can be removed from this list.

#Ready Ideas
- Make drinking from spring happen while adjacent to tile instead of on tile, to stop issue where chars are blocked from drinking by idle chars hanging out
- Game Mechanics a little disorganized, inconsistent about what level of detail it share. Clean up.
- Put character names in their own special file so its super easy for users/me to add more names.
    - Names to remember to add next: Bog, Log, Fen, Pod, Bough, Toady, Tarn, Weir,
    - Bine, Brome, Brume, Cress, Daub, Nook, Fir, Frond, Furl, Rye
    - Muld, Grue, Gnarl, Peat, Pad, Sod, Sprout
- Remove single char mode from UI
- Flag for character count control
- ability to edit name of existing character on map
- sticks and nuts spawn randomly, but do not grow, they are "placed" on the ground by falling from the canopy.
- make background of map green
- generate pond at world beginning
- generate stream at world beginning
- generate clay pit?? Maybe later for clay crafting

# Ideas that aren't ready yet:
- hello world loading screen
- Adjust start screen title and start keys (low)
    - === Petri ===
    - R to start with Random Characters
    - C to create Characters
- Extended ascii art mushrooms on title screen
- Reorder the fields in the Details panel (low - still needs product decision)

### Key Design Patterns

- **MVU Architecture**: Bubble Tea handles rendering diffs automatically
- **Intent System**: Characters calculate Intent, then intents applied atomically (enables future parallelization)
- **Multi-Stat Urgency**: Tiers 0-4, highest wins, tie-breaker: Thirst > Hunger > Energy
- **Stat Fallback**: If intent can't be fulfilled, falls through to next urgent stat
- **Sparse Grid + Indexed Slices**: O(1) character lookups, separate slices for characters/items/features

### Data Flow

1. `Update()` → `updateGame()`
2. `UpdateSurvival()`: timers, stat changes, damage, sleep/wake
3. `CalculateIntent()`: evaluate tiers, try each in priority, track failures
4. `applyIntent()`: accumulate speed/progress, execute actions
5. `View()`: render UI (Bubble Tea diffs automatically)

### Memory Model Plan

Per BUILD CONCEPT in VISION.txt:

- **ActionLog (Working Memory)**: Per-character recent events, bounded by count
- **Memory (Long-Term)**: Future - selective storage of notable events, persists until death
- No omniscient log - player sees aggregate of character experiences

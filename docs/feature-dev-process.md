When the user is ready to start a new feature within a phase:

1. Review the claude.md file for current roadmap status
2. Review the requirements document, phase plan, and feature plan for that feature, ask questions, and confirm approach before starting implementation.
3. Update plan document with new clarifications/decisions/approaches before starting implementation.
4. When starting implementation, Use a TDD approach, see docs/testingProcess for details
5. When implementing reveals broader design questions, pause to review architecture before proceeding.
6. **Keep docs current**: Include README, Claude.md, and docs/game-mechanics updates as todo items when implementing features. Don't defer documentation to end of session.

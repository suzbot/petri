**Phase VI: Containers and Storage**

# General Idea:

- Characters can craft containers, and store things in them.
- Items can be placed on the ground, and picked up.

# Story:

Characters will be able to interact with a gourd, and have a chance to discover how to craft a
hollow gourd vessel. If the user creates an order to craft a vessel, and the character knows how to
craft a vessel, then they can take that order and do so. A character carrying a vessel can put things in it.
Items, including vessels that contain other items, can be dropped on the ground and picked up again.

# Open Ideas and Questions:

A. Say a gourd is picked, and then put on the ground. That gourd shouldn't be able to spawn anymore.
    But it should be able to be consumed or used in a craft just like it would otherwise,
    retaining the same effects on consumption that it would have before. Likewise, flowers that have been
    picked from their spawn point, but then put back down, should not be able to spawn
    (but maybe they still die?). What is the best way to differentiate growing plants from picked plants?
B. Should a character be discovering the concept of crafting a vessel in general, and right now the only
    vessel recipe that materials are all available for is a 'hollow gourd vessel'?
    OR are they only learning the recipe for hollow gourd vessel? Imagine that in the future there are
    also recipes for wood bucket vessel and clay pot vessel.
C. How do we want to formalize our item categories? currently we have a string of plants. but with this
we'll now have these conceptual definitions... how should we handle these:
    - A 'container' can hold a certain amount of other items.
        - Some containers will be portable (can have items put in while being carried), and some will not.
        - Some containers will be watertight (can hold liquids), and some will not.
        - Other future properties might include open vs closed, or lockable
    - One kind of container would be a 'vessel'
        - a vessel will always be portable
        - a vessel will always be watertight
        - once a variety of item is put in that vessel, only that variety can be put in it
        - tbd whether all vessels will have the same capacity,
          but we can assume that at first avessel can hold 1 stack
    - A variety of vessel would be a 'hollow gourd' vessel
        - the recipe for a 'hollow gourd' vessel would be
            - 1 gourd
            - a defined amount of time
    - a 'Plant' is something that is spawned on world creation, and reproduces from the spot it was spawned.
        - idea: maybe once a plant is harvested it becomes an 'ingredient' or a 'material' or something?
        - gourds, mushrooms, berries, and flowers are all plants

# Requirements

A. **New Activity Craft a vessel** (see open question on recipe/variety specificity)
    1. Discoverable, when:
        i. engaging in any gourd interaction (looking, picking up, consuming)
        ii. engaging in any spring interaction (drinking)
    2. Orderable: when adding new task, select 'Craft' option, then select 'vessel' option
    3. Recipe: Craft 1 gourd for 2 minutes.
        if accepting a 'craft vessel' order and using hollow gourd recipe, character will need to check
        to see if they have a gourd in their inventory
            i.  if yes, begin crafting
            ii. if no, target a gourd to pick up. If inventory is full, drop what is in inventory
            in order to pick up the target gourd. Once gourd is in inventory, start crafting.
B. **Interacting with a vessel**
    1. If a character has just crafted an item, and there is room in their inventory,
    then they start carrying it. Otherwise, they drop it. (will be true of any item)
    2. If a character is carrying an empty vessel, they can put 1 stack of items in it
    when picking up items (capacity can be part of the vessel definition for now)
        i. stack size should probably be an attribute of an item itself,
        proportional to its ability to sate hunger.
            For example:
            a. Mushrooms - 10
            b. Berries - 20
            c. Gourds - 1
            d. Flowers - 10
        ii. once one item has been put in a vessel, then only items of the same exact variety
        can be put in that vessel (part of vessel definition, not containers in general)
        iii. if foraging, then they can fill their portable container before stopping
        (unless interrupted or out of matching varieties for that vessel)
        iv. if harvesting, then their order isn't complete until their portable is full
        OR or out of matching varieties on map for that vessel)
    3. If a character is not carrying a portable container, when starting a foraging or harvesting activity, then
    they can look for an empty portable container first.
        i. Consider allowing a foraging or harvesting character to start by picking up a partially full
        vessel if the variety it contains matches an available qualifying target
    4. If a character is carrying a portable container, in any full or empty state,
    when it blocks their action, then they can drop the container.
    5. If a character is carrying a vessel containing an edible item, then that edible item counts as
    a carried item for purposes of eating when hungry, like existing eating carried item logic.

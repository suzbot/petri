### Collaboration Process

When the user is ready to plan the next phase:

1. Read the roadmap portion of claude.md to find what the next phase is
2. Read the requirements document for the next phase
3. Provide feedback, ask clarifying questions, compare options with trade-offs for high-level approaches. Phase plan should identify iterative approach with frequent human testing checkpoints.
4. Save the high-level phase plan in the corresponding phase[#]plan document. Detailed plans for each feature within the phase will go in corresponding sub documents.
5. For clarifications on features that don't impact the high-level approach, save those questions in feature plan docs, to ask in context when approached for implementation.
6. Features within a phase will be approached one at a time, with fresh discussion, todos, and testing for each.

This is a work in progress.

New Item: Tall Grass
	- Spawns at world creation (2x as many as other plant types)
	- Pale Green
	- Growing, reproduces like other plants
	- Bears seeds in the same manner as flowers that can be picked up by foraging
	- As a plant, should show up on the harvest list
	- Harvested grass CANNOT be placed in a vessel (too large, may fit in future containers), but can be carried or dropped as a stack
	- A stack of grass is called a bundle. A bundle of grass can have up to 6 pieces in it.
	- a picked up stack can be added to until it has max pieces


New Activity: Gather > Sticks
	- Orderable
	- Appears on order list by default, does not need discovery
	- Gathered sticks CANNOT be placed in a vessel (too large, may fit in future containers), but can be carried or dropped as a stack
	- A stack of sticks is called a bundle. A bundle of sticks can have up to 6 pieces in it.
	- a picked up stack can be added to until it has max pieces

New Feature: Clay
	- on world generation, 6-10 tiles on the map are 'clay' tiles (reddish brown pattern)
	- tiles must be adjacent to a water tile
	- tiles must be adjacent to at least one other clay tile
	- are passable

New Action: Gather > Clay
	- loose in hand pick up 1 clay from clay tile (clay tile is infinite source like water source)
	- available by default, does not require know-how
	- orderable

New Activity: Craft > Bricks
	- orderable
	- discoverable chance by picking up or looking at clay
	- user selects number of bricks to craft

New Activity: Construct > Fence
	Recipe: Thatch Fence - 1 bundle of 6 per tile
	Recipe: Stick Fence - 1 bundle of 6 per tile
	Recipe: Brick Fence - 6 bricks per tile

Material Durability

Preference Formation:
 - Characters can look at Construction
 - Characters can form a like/dislike materials in the construction they look at
 	- Thatch
 	- Sticks
 	- Bricks

New Activity: Construct > Hut
	Recipe: Thatch Hut - 2 full bundles per tile x 16 tiles
	Recipe: Stick Hut - 2 full bundles per tile x 16 tiles
	Recipe: Brick Hut - 12 bricks per tile x 16 tiles
	Action - marked tiles for construction get all their supplies dropped on them and then each tile with all its supplies is worked for a duration before worker moves to start next tile
	Outcome - 4x4 outline of tiles around 3x3 opening inside; tiles are not passable except one tile which is a door (only passable by chars)

New Concept: Incomplete Order? Or Occupation? How do we handle supply chain issues when a construction task can't be finished? or is it assigned forever until done? but that blocks other orders they could do in the meanntime?

## Implementation Notes

### Available Picking Helpers (internal/system/picking.go)

Existing:
- `EnsureHasVesselFor(char, target, items, gameMap, log, dropConflict, category)` - returns intent to get vessel for target, or nil if ready

Deferred helpers to add when implementing:
- `EnsureHasItem(char, itemType, items, gameMap, log, dropConflict, category)` - for procuring specific item type
- `EnsureHasItemByPreference(char, itemType, items, gameMap, log, dropConflict, category)` - for procuring by preference/distance
- `EnsureHasRecipeInputs(char, recipe, items, gameMap, log, category)` - for multi-component gathering
- `EnsureHasBundle` - TBD, see bundle discussion below

### Bundle and "too large for vessel" logic

Before implementing bundles and the "too large for vessel" behavior, discuss with user. The picking.go prerequisite helpers may need extension, but the exact approach for bundles (stacking in hand vs inventory slot behavior) needs clarification before adding helpers like `EnsureHasBundle`.

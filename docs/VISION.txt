**PETRI PROJECT - VISION STATEMENT**

The Petri Project is a simulation game inspired by Dwarf Fortress exploring the emergent development of culture
within a community.

# CORE CONCEPT
At its heart, Petri simulates how culture arises from the ground up - not as a
predetermined set of traits, but as an emergent property of individual personalities,
preferences, and environmental constraints. Each civilization begins with founding
individuals whose unique attributes and values shape the initial cultural seeds.

# THE SIMULATION
Culture will evolve through the interaction of:
- Individual attributes, moods, preferences, and memories of community members
- Available environmental resources and constraints
- Material properties and technological possibilities
- Social interactions, relationships, and shared experiences over generations
- Creation of cultural artifacts and transfer of knowledge

# AUDIENCE
Petri is built for players who appreciate deep simulation systems - those who find joy
in watching complex behaviors emerge from simple rules, and seeing how their interventions shape what grows.

# BUILD CONCEPT
Instead of an omniscient log of everything that has ever happened in the world,
the history of the world is kept in the memories events within individuals, and the
writings and cultural artifacts that they create. As characters die, their knowledge of
technology and events also dies, except in what they have created or communicated. In this
way, the structure of the game data itself will be isomorphic with the cultural history of
the simulated community.

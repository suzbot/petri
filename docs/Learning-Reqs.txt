- Enhanced Learning: Discovery, Recipe Sharing, Teaching, and Observation
- Depends on: Basic Construction


 New Activity: Pondering
 	- Orderable
 	- Default, like foraging, it doesn't need to be explicitly discovered 
 	- a pondering character will choose a random item from their inventory or map to look at. While pondering, the baseline chance of making any discovery is doubled. 
 	- Duration: Medium

 New Edible Item Attribute: isInspiring
 	- At world creation, one mushroom will have a property of 'Inspiring'
 		- this can overlap with healing or poison, not mutually exclusive with any other mushroom property
 	- They get a new 'Inspired' status with flashing * icon
 		- during inspired status, their Mood will not decay, even due to other needs
 	- Near term: it causes them to unassign themselves from their current job, if any, and randomly selects whether they will either:
 		- go into Pondering activity
 		- go into Sitting activity (this is just like Idle, but doesn't trigger Idle activity selection)
 		- Medium Duration, NOT interruptable by needs when in Inspired state
 	- Long Term: may have random chance to do other Inspired activities

 New Talking Outcome: Recipe Sharing
 	- If the receiving character has the overarching know-how, then they are eligible to receive a recipe for that know-how from someone who is talking to them, if they don't know it already.
 	- Use Basic Construction Recipes to test this, since they all have multiple recipes.

 ? New Idle Activity: Observe
  - an idle character follows arround a character performing know-how that they don't know how to do
  - if they are able to remain adjacent to them for [minimum duration], then they learn that know-how

 New Activity: Teach
 - Discoverable when pondering any item
 - Orderable
 - User can select the know-how to be taught
 - A character who has teaching know-how will attract all idle characters to themself
 - once one or more idle characters is adjacent to them, they will begin teaching
 - after medium duration, they will have transferred one of their know-hows to any adjacent character who had been in their proximity for some minimum duration, who did not already have that know-how
 - if they are interrupted by needs, they will start over in their attempt to attract/teach
